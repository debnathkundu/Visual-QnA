## Image Q&A with Google's Gemini Pro

This app allows you to upload an image, ask a question about it, and get insights using Google's Gemini Pro AI model.

### How It Works

1. **Enter Your API Key**: You'll need a Google API key to access Gemini Pro.
    You can get yours from here: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. **Upload Your Image**: Upload any image you want to ask questions about.
3. **Ask a Question**: Ask a question related to the image, and the AI will provide an answer.

# Input for API key
api_key = st.text_input("Enter your Google API Key:", type="password", key="api_key_input")

# Set the API key for Google Generative AI
genai.configure(api_key=api_key)

    # with open(image_path, "rb") as img_file:
    # image_data = img_file.read()

    image = Image.open(img_file)

    # Choose a Gemini API model.
    model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-1.5-pro-latest")

    # Prompt the model with text and the previously uploaded image.
    response = model.generate_content([image, "Prompt: "+question])

    # # Make the request to the Gemini API
    # response = model.generate_content(
    #     prompt=f"Question: {question}",
